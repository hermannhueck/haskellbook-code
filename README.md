# Haskell Programming from first Principles - Code and Exercise Solutions

This repository contains the code of the chapters and of the exercises
solutions of the book "Haskell Programming from first Principles" by
Christopher Allen and Julie Moronnuki.

http://haskellbook.com/

The book is a great intro to Haskell Programming.

While digging through the book I copy-pasted the code from the book
into my IDE to make the examples run. The repo also contains my solutions
for the book's exercises.

I provide my solutions. But I must repeat Chris' advice: Solve the exercises
yourself. Thus you gain more. If you cheat you betray yourself. Nonetheless
it is good to compare the solution, you worked out, to mine or to the solution
of others. There are many out there.

Have fun.
